The two main airlines flying to and from Iceland are [Icelandair][icelandair]
and [WOW air][wowair]. When you arrive, you will land at the International
Airport in Keflavík. This is approximately a 45 minute drive from Reykjavík. You
can take a [flybus][flybus] costing 2.500kr to the bus terminal in Reykjavík, or
3.000kr with a connection to your hotel in Reykjavík.  

We expect to have partial travel support available for U.S. citizens and
permanent residents. Flights must be to and from the US and must be purchased
from US-based airlines (or US flag carriers). Priority will be given to
undergraduates, graduate students, and early career faculty and researchers.
More information will be posted closer to the date of the conference.
