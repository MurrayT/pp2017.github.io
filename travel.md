We expect to have partial travel support available for U.S. citizens and
permanent residents. Flights must be to and from the US and must be purchased
from US-based airlines (or US flag carriers). Priority will be given to
undergraduates, graduate students, and early career faculty and researchers.
More information will be posted closer to the date of the conference.
