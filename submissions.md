Please submit your abstracts to the conference email at
pp2017conference@gmail.com.

If you must be presenting in order to apply for travel funding at your
institution, please submit your abstract early, as soon as it is ready, at which
point the scientific committee will be able to decide whether or not to accept
it, at least as a poster. Once the submission deadline has passed, the committee
will decide which submissions will be upgraded to talks.

The abstract submission deadline is June 1st.
