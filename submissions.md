The abstract submission deadline is June 1, 2017. Please send your title and
abstract submission as a .pdf file (with the source .tex file and accompanying
figures, if any) to the organizing committee pp2017conference@gmail.com.

Extended abstracts of 2-5 pages are encouraged, but abstracts of any length up
to 5 pages will be accepted. In your submission email, please state whether you
wish to give a talk or a poster presentation.

If you must be presenting in order to apply for travel funding at your
institution, please submit your abstract early, as soon as it is ready, at which
point the scientific committee will be able to decide whether or not to accept
it, at least as a poster. Once the submission deadline has passed, the committee
will decide which submissions will be upgraded to talks.
