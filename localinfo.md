Reykjavík University can be found at the address [Menntavegur 1, 101
Reykjavík][maptouniversity]. The bus number 5 will stop in front of the
building.

We highly recommend using the Stræto app when using the buses. This allows you
to pay for tickets, plan your routes, view timetables plus see precisely where
all the buses are from your phone. The app is available for Android and iPhone.
You want to catch the number 5 to Nauthóll/HR to get to the university. Tickets
are 440kr per trip, no change is given on the buses however a ticket permits 75
minutes of bus usage. If you are not using the app, and require to swap buses
ask the driver for a transfer ticket. For more information about the buses check
the [stræto webpage][straeto].

The average high temperature in June is about 12°C (54°F), and low temperature
is 7°C (45°F). There will however be plenty daylight. The sun will set around
midnight and rise around 3am (between you and me, it doesn't get dark at all!).
