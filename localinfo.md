We highly recommend using the Stræto app for using the buses. This allows you to
pay for tickets, plan your routes, view timetable plus see precisely where all
the buses are from your phone. The app is available for Android and iPhone. You
want to catch the number 5 to Nauthóll to get to the university. Tickets are
440kr per trip, no change is given on the buses however a ticket permits 75
minutes of bus usage. If you are not using the app, and require to swap buses
ask the driver for a transfer ticket.

For any further info please contact the conference organizers at
